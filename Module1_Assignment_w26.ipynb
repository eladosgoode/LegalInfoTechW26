If you don't have any on hand, you can find some problem sets in Harvard's [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022). Use generative AI prompts (in Colab's generate with AI function, Github's CoPilot, or OpenAI's ChatGPT) to create code that solves the problem. Does the code provided work? Is it similar to how you would have solved the problem? Paste one example below."
